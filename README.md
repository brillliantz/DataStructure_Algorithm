# DataStructure_Algorithm
## What's Here
Record my Learning Process, together with course assignments.

## Tool Chain
I am addicted to:
- working with *plain text* files
- seperation between *content* and *styles*

Therefore the tool chain of my choice is like:
- [Vim](www.vim.org) / Vim-mode-plugins for all coding / report writing
- [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) to precisely control
my output, meanwhile playing with *code blocks* and *formulas*.
- html+CSS: convert `.md` file to raw `.html` file, then add styles using
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="dir/my_style.css">`.
- [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/): the best html-to-pdf converter *throughout the world*, which
 can ensure the output PDF is the same as what you see on your *own* computer.

## Recommendations
- [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/): do not manually draw binary trees!
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/): Google: 90% of our engineers 
use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/): easy to use, light weight online MarkDown editor.
- [Typora](www.typora.io): cross-platform, many features integrated markdown editor.

- [VisuAlgo](http://visualgo.net/): fully and intuitively understand datastructures and algorithms!
